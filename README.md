# instagram-bot
Project to generate and update daily updates to instagram. 
Key motivation is to create animation with a seamless loop. An example of the 
produced output.

## Installation
It should be fairly simple to install this project (if you are on Ubuntu), if 
you are on Windows, then, well, feel free to make my code cross platform :)

1. install ffmpeg (google it)
2. create a chrome profile called Person 1
3. install selenium with a chromedriver (google it)
4. install all python packages `pip install -r reqs.txt`
5. Login to your instagram account from the Person 1 profile

You can then execute the `main.py` script which is going to post the 
automatically generated `.mp4` file.
